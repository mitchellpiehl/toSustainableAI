                    <p>
                        One significant benefit of artificial intelligence systems is the ability to help improve sustainable practices across many different fields. 
                        In many fields AI can help improve efficiency of operations, decrease cost of production, monitor important variables, and help solve challenging problems. 
                        The three main aspects of AI helping sustainability that this website will explore are through resource management, climate monitoring and the supply chain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Artificial Intelligence can help resource management by predicting resource needs for a project, and assigning tools and resources in the most efficient ways possible.
                        AI may help climate monitoring by noticing important changes within the environment. Explore the following to learn more about how AI can help the enviroment.

                    <p>
                        The use of artificial intelligence in the supply chain drastically improves planning, production, and management in many different ways. 
                        The ability of AI to process imense supplies of data allows it to predict trends and changes in the market, and improve decision making and efficiency of operations. This helps it to reduce waste and lower costs within the supply chain of any market.
                        AI can also help optimize routes within the supply chain, minimize shortages, and help automate tasks. This helps increase sustainability by optimizing truck loads and truck routes to lower their carbon footprint.

                    <p>
                        There are many compaines already implementing and seeing the benefits of using AI in supply chain management. 
                        In addition to helping increase sustainability, AI in the supply chain improves customer experience by helping to track packages, increase reliability, and provide more information about processes.

                    <p>
                        AI is significantly impacting resource management in a variety of ways. 
                        AI is helping to enhance resource allocations by making smart recommendations by analyzing data and making predictions, and by optimizing resouce utilization by analyzing what resources are being inefficiently used. 
                        AI can also automize a various number of tasks, and do certain tasks more accurately than before, such as scheduling, reporting and resource tracking which minimizes wastes in these areas.
                        Another benefit of AI is by analyzing potential risks before they happen so there is less waste.

                        Artificial Intelligence has the ability to monitor amounts of information that have never been possible before.
                        The ability to monitor and process this amount of information allows AI to help make predictions about the future, including weather and climate predictions.
                        This can help us prepare for any future climate events, as well as virtually experiment with various potential solutions to find the most effective. This has enormous benefits towards humanities fight on climate change. Continue scrolling to learn more.

                        As the amount of extreme weather events increase due to climate change, AI can help us to make predictions and provide us with sustainable development measures to reduce risks.
                        For example, in areas that are in danger to landslides, AI mapping helps to plan and prepare for land development that reduces the risks.

                        Artificial Intelligence can also measure and track changes in icebergs up to 10,000 times faster than humans. The ability to track icebergs melting so quickly helps scientists
                        understand the amount of water getting released into the ocean and how quickly it is happening. This helps us to better prepare and to know how to take precautionary measures.
